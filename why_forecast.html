	    <br>Why learn to forecast? If a system can learn to accurately predict the consequences of its actions, and people can reliably communicate their preferences of long-term outcomes to it, then the system can be used to achieve good outcomes by planning. There are three appealing aspects of this approach:<br><br>
	    <ol style="text-align:justify">
	      <li><strong>The key learning signal is readily available and objective</strong>. The learning signal is readily available because time-series data is sufficient to construct it (e.g. videos captured by cameras) and objective in that it requires no manual categorization or human judgement.</li><br>
	      <li><strong>Improvements to prediction accuracy translate to improvements in control capability</strong>. A system that that can reliably predict the consequences of its actions is flexible to different tasks -- if a system learns to predict at longer horizons or the dynamics of new parts of the environment, then it can perform tasks at these longer horizons or in new parts of the environment.</li><br>
	      <li><strong>An ability to communicate predictive understanding enables introspection</strong>. Would you rather have a system that can communicate its current plan and expected outcomes, or one that cannot? I believe prediction is a key part of making autonomous systems interpretable enough to be trustworthy.</li>
