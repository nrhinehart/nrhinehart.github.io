We describe a robotic learning system for autonomous navigation in diverse environments. At the core of our method are two components: (i) a non-parametric map that reflects the connectivity of the environment but does not require geometric reconstruction or localization, and (ii) a latent variable model of distances and actions that enables efficiently constructing and traversing this map. The model is trained on a large dataset of prior experience to predict the expected amount of time and next action needed to transit between the current image and a goal image. Training the model in this way enables it to develop a representation of goals robust to distracting information in the input images, which aids in deploying the system to quickly explore new environments. We demonstrate our method on a mobile ground robot in a range of outdoor navigation scenarios. Our method can learn to reach new goals, specified as images, in a radius of up to 80 meters in just 20 minutes, and reliably revisit these goals in changing environments. We also demonstrate our method's robustness to previously-unseen obstacles and variable weather conditions.
